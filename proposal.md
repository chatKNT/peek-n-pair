# [Peek 'N' Pair]

Created by King McLeod and Tyreese Wray.

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, Peek 'N' Pair is for problem-solving/strategy game enthusiasts. It allows users to play a fun memory game with different themes and difficulties.

## API & React Router

This application will use the Dog, Rick and Morty, and Open Trivia Database API's. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- Link to API documentation: [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/)
- https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random/{NUMBER}
  - This will fetch an array of dog images
  - We will use the `message`

- Link to API documentation: [Rick and Morty](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation)
- https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/{NUMBER}
  - This will fetch a single character object based on number input
  - We will use `id`, `name`, `species`, and `image`
- https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/[{NUMBER1},{NUMBER2}]  
  - This will fetch an array of character objects based on the input of numbers
  - For each character, we will use `id`, `name`, `species`, and `image`

- Link to API documentation: [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
- https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount={NUMBER}
  - This will fetch an object with a nested `results` array of a question or quetions based on number input
  - We will use all the values in the `results` array: `type`, `difficulty`, `category`, `question`, `correct_answer` and `incorrect_answers`
- https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount={NUMBER}&difficulty={OPTION}
  - This will fetch an object with a nested `results` array of a question or questions based on number and difficulty input
  - We will use all the values in the `results` array: `type`, `difficulty`, `category`, `question`, `correct_answer` and `incorrect_answers`
- https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount={NUMBER}&category={NUMBER}&difficulty={OPTION}
  - This will fetch an object with a nested `results` array of a question or questions based on number category, and difficulty input
  - We will use all the values in the `results` array: `type`, `difficulty`, `category`, `question`, `correct_answer` and `incorrect_answers`

**Example:**
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks
  - This will fetch an array of artwork objects
  - For each artwork, I want the `id`, `title`, and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/{id}
  - This will fetch a single artwork object
  - I will use the `id`, `title`, `short_description`, `medium_display`, `place_of_origin` and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q={query}
  - This will fetch a list of artworks that relate to the search query
  - For each artwork, I will use the `id` and `title`
