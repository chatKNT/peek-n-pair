## Reflection Response
Agile practices, such as daily stand-up meetings, facilitated communication and collaboration by making us engage and elaborate on what we had worked on based on the goal or task at hand. It sparked brainstorming of new ideas and helped make sure we were always on the same page, and were constantly making progress towards our tasks on the scrum board. The scrum board played its role by ensuring we were being intentional about what we were working on and distributing the tasks to ensure everything was balanced while both individuals played their part.

Our team created a timeline for reaching MVP features, but as we discussed and worked together, the timeline shifted as well. Nonetheless, it assisted with making sure we weren't spending too much time on one thing and meeting our deadlines, staying aware of what was due and more. What we would have done differently as a group would be prioritizing functionality a bit more strictly before making any attempts at styling.
